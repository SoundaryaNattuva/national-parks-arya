# Treky - National Parks Tracker 🏔️🐻

Embark on a journey of discovery with Treky, your ultimate companion for cataloging every national park adventure. From the sun-dappled valleys of Yosemite to the rugged peaks of Mount Rainier, Treky turns every hike into a quest for exploration, allowing you to collect badges, share memorable trails, and document the wilderness through your eyes. 

Dive into the Treky app, where every trail tells a story, and every badge is a trophy of your adventures across America's vast natural wonders.

## The game-play is as follows 👾

1. You have 6 tries to guess a 5-letter word that is space-related. 
2. For every guess, the color of the tile is revealed telling you whether the letter is in the right spot (green), wrong sport (yellow) or not part of the word at all (gray).
3. If you want to dive into another word sometime through the game, or when you are finished, you can click the rocket icon 🚀 on the top right to launch a new game.
